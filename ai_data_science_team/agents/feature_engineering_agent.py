def make_feature_engineering_agent(model, log=False, log_path=None, overwrite = True, human_in_the_loop=False):
    """
    Creates a feature engineering agent that can be run on a dataset. The agent applies various feature engineering
    techniques, such as encoding categorical variables, scaling numeric variables, creating interaction terms,
    and generating polynomial features. The agent takes in a dataset and user instructions and outputs a Python
    function for feature engineering. It also logs the code generated and any errors that occur.
    
    The agent is instructed to apply the following feature engineering techniques:
    
    - Remove string or categorical features with unique values equal to the size of the dataset
    - Remove constant features with the same value in all rows
    - High cardinality categorical features should be encoded by a threshold <= 5 percent of the dataset, by converting infrequent values to "other"
    - Encoding categorical variables using OneHotEncoding
    - Numeric features should be left untransformed
    - Create datetime-based features if datetime columns are present
    - If a target variable is provided:
        - If a categorical target variable is provided, encode it using LabelEncoding
        - All other target variables should be converted to numeric and unscaled
    - Convert any boolean True/False values to 1/0
    - Return a single data frame containing the transformed features and target variable, if one is provided.
    - Any specific instructions provided by the user

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : langchain.llms.base.LLM
        The language model to use to generate code.
    log : bool, optional
        Whether or not to log the code generated and any errors that occur.
        Defaults to False.
    log_path : str, optional
        The path to the directory where the log files should be stored. Defaults to "logs/".
    overwrite : bool, optional
        Whether or not to overwrite the log file if it already exists. If False, a unique file name will be created. 
        Defaults to True.
    human_in_the_loop : bool, optional
        Whether or not to use human in the loop. If True, adds an interput and human in the loop step that asks the user to review the feature engineering instructions. Defaults to False.

            You are a Feature Engineering Expert. Given the following information about the data, 
            recommend a series of numbered steps to take to engineer features. 
            The steps should be tailored to the data characteristics and should be helpful 
            for a feature engineering agent that will be implemented.
            
            General Steps:
            Things that should be considered in the feature engineering steps:
            
            * Convert features to the appropriate data types based on their sample data values
            * Remove string or categorical features with unique values equal to the size of the dataset
            * Remove constant features with the same value in all rows
            * High cardinality categorical features should be encoded by a threshold <= 5 percent of the dataset, by converting infrequent values to "other"
            * Encoding categorical variables using OneHotEncoding
            * Numeric features should be left untransformed
            * Create datetime-based features if datetime columns are present
            * If a target variable is provided:
                * If a categorical target variable is provided, encode it using LabelEncoding
                * All other target variables should be converted to numeric and unscaled
            * Convert any Boolean (True/False) values to integer (1/0) values. This should be performed after one-hot encoding.
            
            Custom Steps:
            * Analyze the data to determine if any additional feature engineering steps are needed.
            * Recommend steps that are specific to the data provided. Include why these steps are necessary or beneficial.
            * If no additional steps are needed, simply state that no additional steps are required.
            
            IMPORTANT:
            Make sure to take into account any additional user instructions that may add, remove or modify some of these steps. Include comments in your code to explain your reasoning for each step. Include comments if something is not done because a user requested. Include comments if something is done because a user requested.

            Best Practices and Error Preventions:
            - Handle missing values in numeric and categorical features before transformations.
            - Avoid creating highly correlated features unless explicitly instructed.
            - Convert Boolean to integer values (0/1) after one-hot encoding unless otherwise instructed.
            
            Avoid the following errors:
            
            - name 'OneHotEncoder' is not defined
            
            - Shape of passed values is (7043, 48), indices imply (7043, 47)
